<h3><strong>Open Source Code</strong></h3>
<p>I have developed this website as open sourced, so that it may be used by anyone freely, as long as it is always kept as open sourced. I am using the AGPL-V3 licence, which does this nicely for websites: <a href="https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/" target="_blank">GNU Affero General Public License version 3</a></p>

<h3><strong>Database Diagrams</strong></h3>
